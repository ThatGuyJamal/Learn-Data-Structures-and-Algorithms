# Graphs and Graph Algorithms

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll explore graphs and graph algorithms, their properties, and their usage in Rust. Graphs are fundamental data structures used in various applications such as social networks, routing algorithms, and more.

### Key Points

- **Graphs**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Techniques to traverse, search, and analyze graphs.

## Graphs

A graph is a data structure that consists of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes. There are different types of graphs:

- **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction; the connection between nodes is bidirectional.
- **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have a direction; the connection between nodes is unidirectional.
- **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights or costs associated with them.
- **Unweighted Graph**: Edges do not have weights.

### Basic Graph Implementation

Here’s a basic implementation of an undirected graph in Rust using adjacency lists:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Graph {
    adj_list: HashMap<u32, Vec<u32>>,
}

impl Graph {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Graph {
            adj_list: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }

    fn add_edge(&mut self, u: u32, v: u32) {
        self.adj_list.entry(u).or_insert_with(Vec::new).push(v);
        self.adj_list.entry(v).or_insert_with(Vec::new).push(u);
    }

    fn print(&self) {
        for (node, edges) in &self.adj_list {
            println!("Node {}: {:?}", node, edges);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut graph = Graph::new();
    graph.add_edge(1, 2);
    graph.add_edge(2, 3);
    graph.add_edge(3, 4);

    graph.print();
}
```

### Code Explanation

- **`add_edge`**: Adds an undirected edge between two nodes.
- **`print`**: Displays the adjacency list of the graph.

## Graph Algorithms

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching through a graph. It explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

Here’s a DFS implementation in Rust:

```rust
use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};

fn dfs(graph: &HashMap<u32, Vec<u32>>, start: u32, visited: &mut HashSet<u32>) {
    if visited.contains(&start) {
        return;
    }
    visited.insert(start);
    println!("Visited: {}", start);

    if let Some(neighbors) = graph.get(&start) {
        for &neighbor in neighbors {
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut graph = HashMap::new();
    graph.insert(1, vec![2, 3]);
    graph.insert(2, vec![1, 4]);
    graph.insert(3, vec![1, 4]);
    graph.insert(4, vec![2, 3]);

    let mut visited = HashSet::new();
    dfs(&graph, 1, &mut visited);
}
```

### Code Explanation

- **`dfs`**: Recursively visits nodes, marking them as visited, and explores all neighbors.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching through a graph. It explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Here’s a BFS implementation in Rust:

```rust
use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet, VecDeque};

fn bfs(graph: &HashMap<u32, Vec<u32>>, start: u32) {
    let mut visited = HashSet::new();
    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();

    visited.insert(start);
    queue.push_back(start);

    while let Some(node) = queue.pop_front() {
        println!("Visited: {}", node);

        if let Some(neighbors) = graph.get(&node) {
            for &neighbor in neighbors {
                if !visited.contains(&neighbor) {
                    visited.insert(neighbor);
                    queue.push_back(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut graph = HashMap::new();
    graph.insert(1, vec![2, 3]);
    graph.insert(2, vec![1, 4]);
    graph.insert(3, vec![1, 4]);
    graph.insert(4, vec![2, 3]);

    bfs(&graph, 1);
}
```

### Code Explanation

- **`bfs`**: Uses a queue to explore nodes level by level, marking nodes as visited.

## Real World Examples

### Graphs

Graphs are used in various applications such as:

- **Social Networks**: Representing connections between users.
- **Routing Algorithms**: Finding the shortest path in network routing and GPS navigation.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Based on user preferences and item relationships.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is used in:

- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: For maze-solving or puzzle-solving.
- **Topological Sorting**: In directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for scheduling tasks.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is used in:

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: For finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **Level Order Traversal**: In trees and graphs, such as hierarchical data processing.

## Conclusion

Graphs and their associated algorithms are crucial for solving complex problems in various domains. Understanding and implementing graph algorithms like DFS and BFS in Rust can help you tackle a wide range of real-world problems more effectively.
