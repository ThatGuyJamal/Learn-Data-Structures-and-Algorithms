# Stacks and Queues

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll explore stacks and queues, their properties and usage in Rust.

### Key Points

- Stacks: A data structure that stores elements in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order.
- Queues: A data structure that stores elements in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order.

## Stacks

A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. This is the opposite of a queue, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Stack<T> {
    items: Vec<T>,
}

impl<T> Stack<T> {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Stack { items: Vec::new() }
    }

    fn push(&mut self, item: T) {
        self.items.push(item);
    }

    fn pop(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
        self.items.pop()
    }

    fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
        self.items.last()
    }

    fn is_empty(&self) -> bool {
        self.items.is_empty()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut stack = Stack::new();
    stack.push(1);
    stack.push(2);
    stack.push(3);

    println!("Stack: {:?}", stack);
    println!("Top item: {:?}", stack.peek());

    while let Some(item) = stack.pop() {
        println!("Popped: {}", item);
    }
}
```

### Code Explanation

- `push` adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `pop` removes the top element from the stack.
- `peek` returns a reference to the top element of the stack.
- `is_empty` returns `true` if the stack is empty, and `false` otherwise.

### Queues

A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added is the first one to be removed. This is the opposite of a stack, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

```rust
use std::collections::VecDeque;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Queue<T> {
    items: VecDeque<T>,
}

impl<T> Queue<T> {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Queue {
            items: VecDeque::new(),
        }
    }

    fn enqueue(&mut self, item: T) {
        self.items.push_back(item);
    }

    fn dequeue(&mut self) -> Option<T> {
        self.items.pop_front()
    }

    fn peek(&self) -> Option<&T> {
        self.items.front()
    }

    fn is_empty(&self) -> bool {
        self.items.is_empty()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut queue = Queue::new();
    queue.enqueue(1);
    queue.enqueue(2);
    queue.enqueue(3);

    println!("Queue: {:?}", queue);
    println!("Front item: {:?}", queue.peek());

    while let Some(item) = queue.dequeue() {
        println!("Dequeued: {}", item);
    }
}
```

### Code Explanation

- `enqueue` adds an element to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue` removes the first element and returns it.
- `peek` returns the first element without removing it.
- `is_empty` checks if the queue is empty.

## Real World Examples

### Stacks

When you browse the web, your browser keeps track of the pages you've visited in a stack-like structure. This allows you to go back to the previous page by popping the most recent page off the stack.

How It Works:

- `Push`: When you navigate to a new page, the URL is pushed onto the stack.
- `Pop`: When you hit the "Back" button, the browser pops the most recent URL from the stack and navigates to it.
- `Peek`: You can see the current URL on top of the stack without removing it.

### Queues

A print spooler manages print jobs sent to a printer. It uses a queue to ensure that print jobs are processed in the order they are received.

How It Works:

- `Enqueue`: When a new print job is submitted, it is added to the end of the queue.
- `Dequeue`: The print spooler processes the print jobs from the front of the queue, printing them one by one.
- `Peek`: You can check the next job to be printed without removing it from the queue.

## Conclusion

Stacks and queues are essential for managing data in various applications. By implementing these structures in Rust, you can handle data efficiently and understand fundamental programming concepts better.
