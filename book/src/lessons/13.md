# Recursion and Backtracking

## Introduction

Recursion and backtracking are fundamental techniques in computer science for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblem's. They are especially useful for problems involving combinatorial search, optimization, and constraint satisfaction. In this lesson, we'll explore these concepts, their principles, and how to implement them in Rust.

### Key Points

- **Recursion**: A technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.
- **Backtracking**: A method for solving problems by trying out possible solutions and reverting to previous steps if a solution doesn't work out.

## Recursion

### Definition

Recursion is a method of solving problems where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A recursive function is one that calls itself directly or indirectly.

### Key Concepts

1. **Base Case**: The condition under which the recursion stops. It's crucial for preventing infinite recursion.
2. **Recursive Case**: The part of the function where it calls itself with modified arguments.

### Example: Factorial

The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It can be defined recursively as:

- `factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)`
- `factorial(0) = 1` (base case)

#### Rust Implementation

```rust
fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if n == 0 {
        1
    } else {
        n * factorial(n - 1)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let n = 5;
    println!("Factorial of {} is {}", n, factorial(n));
}
```

### Explanation

- **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, return 1.
- **Recursive Case**: For any other `n`, return `n * factorial(n - 1)`.

## Backtracking

### Definition

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems by exploring all potential solutions and discarding those that do not meet the constraints. It involves trying out possible solutions, and if a solution is not feasible, it reverts to a previous step and tries another path.

### Key Concepts

1. **Solution Space**: The set of all possible solutions.
2. **Feasible Solution**: A solution that satisfies the problem constraints.
3. **Backtrack**: When a solution path is found to be invalid, revert to a previous step and try a different path.

### Example: N-Queens Problem

The N-Queens problem involves placing `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The challenge is to find all possible arrangements.

#### Rust Implementation

```rust
fn is_safe(board: &Vec<Vec<bool>>, row: usize, col: usize) -> bool {
    // Check this column on previous rows
    for i in 0..row {
        if board[i][col] {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Check upper-left diagonal
    let mut i = row;
    let mut j = col;
    while i >= 0 && j >= 0 {
        if board[i][j] {
            return false;
        }
        if i == 0 || j == 0 {
            break;
        }
        i -= 1;
        j -= 1;
    }

    // Check upper-right diagonal
    i = row;
    j = col;
    while i >= 0 && j < board.len() {
        if board[i][j] {
            return false;
        }
        if i == 0 || j == board.len() - 1 {
            break;
        }
        i -= 1;
        j += 1;
    }

    true
}

fn solve_n_queens(board: &mut Vec<Vec<bool>>, row: usize) -> bool {
    if row >= board.len() {
        return true;
    }

    for col in 0..board.len() {
        if is_safe(board, row, col) {
            board[row][col] = true;
            if solve_n_queens(board, row + 1) {
                return true;
            }
            board[row][col] = false;
        }
    }

    false
}

fn main() {
    let n = 4;
    let mut board = vec![vec![false; n]; n];
    if solve_n_queens(&mut board, 0) {
        println!("Solution found:");
        for row in board {
            for cell in row {
                if cell {
                    print!("Q ");
                } else {
                    print!(". ");
                }
            }
            println!();
        }
    } else {
        println!("No solution found.");
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`is_safe` Function**: Checks if it's safe to place a queen at a given position by verifying column and diagonal constraints.
2. **`solve_n_queens` Function**: Tries placing queens in all columns of the current row and recurses to solve for the next row. If placing a queen leads to a solution, it returns `true`; otherwise, it backtracks by removing the queen and trying the next column.
3. **`main` Function**: Initializes the board and starts the solving process.

## Real World Examples

### Recursion

- **File System Traversal**: Navigating directories and files using recursion.
- **Tree Traversal**: Traversing nodes in a hierarchical tree structure.

### Backtracking

- **Sudoku Solver**: Finding a solution to Sudoku puzzles by trying possible values and backtracking if needed.
- **Path-finding Problems**: Finding a path through a maze or grid by exploring possible paths and retracting when encountering obstacles.

## Conclusion

Recursion and backtracking are essential techniques for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and exploring all possible solutions. Mastering these techniques can enhance your problem-solving skills and help you tackle a wide range of algorithmic challenges.
