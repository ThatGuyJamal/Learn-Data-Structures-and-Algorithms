# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms

## Hello World!

Hello human! Thanks for reading this book on Data Structures and Algorithms. I hope you enjoy it!

This book is written by the lovely [CodingWithJamal](https://x.com/codingwithjamal). It's a written version of
the YouTube series [Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust - YouTube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl0-VFGqwyIvRpNnBcypGKITG2gRip1QD).

## What You Will Learn

In this series, you will:

- Gain a solid understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- Learn how to analyze and evaluate the efficiency of algorithms using Big O Notation.
- See practical implementations of these concepts in Rust, a modern systems programming language.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of computer science
- Willingness to learn
- Following me on [X](https://x.com/codingwithjamal) (Twitter)

## Why Data Structures and Algorithms?

Data structures and algorithms form the backbone of computer science. They are essential for:

- Efficient problem-solving.
- Writing optimized code.
- Preparing for technical interviews and competitive programming.

## Why Rust?

Rust is a modern systems programming language and its strong type system makes it
ideal for learning data structures and algorithms.

## Course Outline

Here is a brief overview of what we will cover in this series:

1. **Getting Started with Rust**: Setting up your environment and writing basic programs.
2. **Understanding Big O Notation**: Learning about time complexity and analyzing algorithms.
3. **Arrays and Vectors**: Working with these basic data structures.
4. **Linked Lists**: Exploring singly and doubly linked lists.
5. **Stacks and Queues**: Understanding these fundamental structures.
6. **Hash Maps and Hash Sets**: Diving into hashing and its applications.
7. **Binary Trees**: Learning about tree structures and their properties.
8. **Heaps and Priority Queues**: Working with heaps and priority queues.
9. **Graphs and Graph Algorithms**: Exploring graph structures and basic algorithms.
10. **Sorting Algorithms**: Understanding and implementing common sorting techniques.
11. **Searching Algorithms**: Exploring linear and binary search methods.
12. **Dynamic Programming**: Learning about memoization and tabulation.
13. **Recursion and Backtracking**: Understanding these powerful techniques.
14. **Recommended Projects**: Future your learning journey.

## Getting Ready

Before we dive into the technical content, make sure you have the following:

- A computer with an internet connection.
- Basic knowledge of programming (experience with any language is a plus).
- The willingness to learn and experiment.

Stay tuned for the next lesson, where we will set up our Rust environment and write our first Rust program. This journey will be challenging but rewarding, and by the end of this series, you will have a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms and how to implement them in Rust.

Thank you for joining me, and I look forward to embarking on this learning journey with you!
